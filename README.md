# Python Loops Assignment

This repository contains my first project on loops in Python. I am solving various problems to enhance my understanding and practice of loop structures in Python.

## Overview

Loops are an essential concept in programming that allow repetitive execution of a block of code. This project focuses on solving different types of problems using **for loops**, **while loops**, and other loop-based constructs in Python.

## Key Features

- **Practical Learning**: Covers a range of problems designed to strengthen your loop implementation skills.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Suitable for those who are new to loops and want to build a strong foundation.
- **Problem-Solving Focus**: Each problem is aimed at improving logical thinking and coding efficiency.

## Topics Covered

1. **For Loops**: Iterating over sequences such as lists, strings, and ranges.
2. **While Loops**: Using conditions to control the flow of execution.
3. **Nested Loops**: Working with loops inside loops.
4. **Break and Continue Statements**: Controlling loop flow with conditional exits and skips.
5. **Practical Examples**: Real-world scenarios where loops are useful.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: 3.7 or higher
- **IDE/Editor**: Any code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook)

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-Loops-Assignment.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Python-Loops-Assignment
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts:
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

## Example Problems

Here are a few example problems included in the assignment:

- Printing numbers in a range using a loop.
- Calculating the factorial of a number.
- Generating patterns using nested loops.
- Summing the elements of a list with a loop.
- Finding prime numbers in a given range.

## Project Goals

- **Learn and practice loops in Python.**
- **Build confidence in solving programming problems.**
- **Lay a foundation for more advanced topics in Python.**

## Contributions

This is a personal project aimed at improving my own skills. If you'd like to provide feedback or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
